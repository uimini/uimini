- Android browser 2.1-4.3 (2009-2013).

## When you NEED to use extra browsers support:

For e-commerce, state projects, etc.

Summing up: it's a good solution for e-commerce (which using jquery or js/css polyfills) to use uimini with extra browsers support.

## When you DON'T NEED to use extra browsers support:

For example:

1. If you gonna use Vue.js 3 (Vue.js 3 is not supported ie 11);
2. If you gonna use React.js + Mobx 4+ (Mobx 4 is not supported ie 11);
3. If you want to use es6+ feature without extra polyfills or modern css.

Summing up: if you using modern JavaScript or modern css (like grids) then YOU DON'T NEED uimini with extra browser support.
