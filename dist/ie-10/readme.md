## When to use

For e-commerce, state projects etc.

Summing up: for e-commerce which using jquery and polyfills it's a good solution to use uimini with extra browsers support.

## When NOT TO USE

For example:

1. If you gonna use Vue.js 3 which not supported ie 11 then you don't need extra browser support.
2. If you gonna use React.js + Mobx 4+ (also not supported ie 11) then you don't need extra browser support.
3. When you using es6+ feature without bable and extra polyfills. Cause that's means you don't support old browsers then you don't need extra browser support.

Summing up: if you using modern JavaScript (or modern css like grids) then you don't need uimini with extra browser support.
